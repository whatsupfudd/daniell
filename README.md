# DANIELL
## A fast static site builder compatible with HUGO.


### Goal: generate static website from markup files, with ability to read HUGO site definitions and templates.

### The general logic is to:
- read the driving configuration for driving static site generation from a list of markup files,
- parse the folders and collect all relevant files,
- apply transformation logic from descriptions to HTML and associated resources,
- provide either a HTTP access for browsing the site, or a stand-alone version of the content ready for publication on CDNs.

### Implementation:
- use Haskell for code base,
- inspire template processing from [Ginger](https://github.com/tdammers/ginger),
- inspire script interpretation from [Co](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/implementing-co-2/),
- use Servant for web services,

### Commands:
- *no arguments* : reads the current folder and creates a version of the static site in the *public* sub-folder.
- **new site** <path> : populates a folder *path* with the required basic scaffholding, creating the folder if it doesn't already exist.
- **new** <path> : creates a markup file at *path* with the minimal content to be useful in static site processing.
- **server** : creates an internal representation of the static site and and make it available to browsers on a HTTP channel.
- **mod init** <path> : populates a folder *path> with the required basic scaffholding for a **module**, creates the folder *path* if it doesn't already exist.
- **mod get** : updates the modules from their git repo.

### Site Description Folder Structure:
- archetypes:
- assets: resources used by the scriting logic (pipes) in on-the-fly no-markup content transformation.
- content: the top level container for all markup files that will lead to the generation of pages in the static site. Its subfolders correspond to sub-sections of the site.
- data: files providing structured datasets to the scripting logic for inclusion into the content transformation (eg rows of records).
- layouts: templates of HTML and scripting logic that drive the transformation logic of markup files into static web pages.
- public: publishable version of the static site.
- static: resources that support the rendering of pages in the static site (images, style sheets, javascript, etc). This folder is recreated as is in the public folder when a version of the static site is created.
- themes: reusable version of site definitions that provide a much faster and simpler creation process.
- config.<ext> : the configuration for driving the transformation logic, provided either in yaml, toml or json format.


### Transformation concept:
The main idea for the transformation of the site description into a static site of HTML pages is to apply to each markup file found in the hierarchy of folders in *content* the simple formula of:
    Transform interpreter-context markup template => static-page.html

The main transformation logic is provided by a path.html template file, which contains a mix of HTML code and golang *template/text* scripting statements.


### Templating structure:
The *layout* folder provides at the top level templates for kinds of pages that are pre-defined in the logic. Each subfolder in *layout* defines templating logic for the kind of page named identically to the subfolder.

Templates can provides *blocks* of definitions with the directive *define <label>*.  A block can be applied with the *block <label>* directive.
  
If there is file *baseof.html* is present in a folder, it serves as a base defintion for every other template file. In this case, the *baseof.html* template will be the main logic, and other templates will provide alternative block definitions that the main logic uses, similarly to an abstract class logic that is complemented by concrete class implementations.

If there is a *partials* folder in the *layout* folder, files in that folder will represent a *subroutine* of templating logic.  The *partial <path.html>* directive in a template will get the logic to insert the content of the *path.html* file (relative to *layout/partials*) at that position in the calling template, and instatiate a new interpreter context to process its content to generate static text.  the *partial <path.html> .* directive will pass the existing interpreter context to the generating logic.


### Template scripting:
WHen transforming a markup file, the simplest template is made purely of HTML text, which means that none of the markup content being used for the generation of the static page.  It is the absorbant case.

Content from the markup file can be inserted in the HTML text by using the **{{ <value> }}** syntax. The *<value>* will be transformed based on the interpreter context and inserted at the position it appears into the HTML stream of text.

For example to transfer all of the content of a markup file at a given position through the HTML stream of text, it is simply a matter of putting *{{ .Content }}* at that position. The *.Content* value is a predefined variable in the interpreter context that is simply all the content of the markup file being processed.

Beside value inserting, the scripting syntax provides typical control structures and function application to source values.  The statements are:
    {{ if <cond> }} TrueBlock [ {{ else }} FalseBlock ] {{ end }}
    {{ with <value> }} JustBlock [ {{ else }} NothingBlock ] {{ end }}
    {{ range <array | slice | map | channel> }} LoopBlock [ {{ else }} OtherwiseBlock ] {{ end }}
    {{ break }}
    {{ continue }}
    {{ template <label> [ <context> ] }}
 *var-def* and *var-assign* are also statements.


A <value> is called a *pipeline* in golang *template/text* library.  It is defined as:
    <pipelines> ::= <pipeline> | "(" <pipeline> ")"
    <pipeline> ::= <args> | <call>
    <call> ::= <function> [ <args> ] [ "|" <call> ]
    <args>::= <var> | <constant> | "."
    <var> ::= "." <predef-label> | <local-var>
    <local-var> ::= "$" <label>
    <var-def> ::= <local-var> ":=" <pipelines>
    <var-assign> ::= <local-var> "=" <pipelines>


### Markup file to Layout association:
- _index.md => list
- *anything*.md => single

### Resource transformatoin:
Files in *assets* folder can be passed through scripting pipeline to obtain HTML text.  For example, if the SCSS file *assets/sass/style.scss* is available for styling, a template can do:
    {{ $style := resources.Get "sass/style.scss" | resources.ToCSS | resources.Minify }}
and then:
    ... href="{{ $style.Permalink }}" ...
to obtain both a CSS file in the resulting static site and a link referring to that file in the HTML code that will use the CSS styling.

### Daniell implementation
- configuration logic (yaml, htoml, aeson) + cli (options-applicative)
- folder hierarchy traversal for acquiring config, markup, templates and theme files ([dir-traverse](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dir-traverse), [pathwalk](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pathwalk))
- associtation logic for markup and templates
- markup files parser ([mmark](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmark), [cmark](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cmark))
- template files parser
- scripting interpreter
- simple http service for providing browser access to the static site generated (wai, warp, servant)
- publishing logic to construct a self-sufficient folder for the static site
